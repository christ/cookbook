## Dry Spices:

##  Other herbs/spices:
* 6 garlic cloves, finely grated
* 4 teaspoons finely grated peeled ginger
* ¾ cup chopped fresh cilantro plus sprigs for garnish

## All other ingredients:

* 1½ cups whole-milk yogurt (not Greek)
* 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, halved lengthwise
* 3 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or vegetable oil
* 1 small onion, thinly sliced
* ¼ cup tomato paste
* 1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
* 2 cups heavy cream
* Steamed basmati rice (for serving)

## Equipment

You’ll need a garlic press, grater, baking sheet and aluminum foil.

## Preparation

### 6-8 hours before dinner:

Cut up chicken to desired size.

Combine garlic, ginger, turmeric, garam masala, coriander, and salt. Whisk in the yogurt.

Divide this mixture in half, and put the chicken in one of the bowls, stirring to coat. Put both bowls in fridge to marinate for 4-6 hours.

### 2 - 3 hours before dinner:

Heat ghee (or butter) in a large heavy pot or wok on medium heat. Add onion, tomato paste, cardamom and chiles, and cook, stirring often, until tomato paste has darkened and onion is soft. 5-10 minutes.

Add the half of the yoghurt mixture without the chicken in it, stirring frequently so it doesn’t stick to the bottom. Cook for about 5-10 additional minutes.

Add tomatoes with juices, crushing them with your hands as you add them. Bring to boil, and then reduce to very low heat, and let it simmer, stirring occasionally so it doesn’t stick, an additional 10 minutes.

Add the heavy cream and chopped cilantro, and thel let it keep simmering for another 40 minutes to thicken to desired consistency.

While it is simmering, arrange the chicken on a baking tray, and put on the top rack under the broiler. Broil until it starts to brown and blacken in spots. (It will not be cooked through at this point.) This will take maybe 10 minutes.

Then, add the chicken and any remaining sauce to the main pot, and allow it to continue to simmer on very low heat until dinner time.

### Dinner time!

Serve over rice, with chapatis. Invite awesome friends.

(Inviting awesome friends should probably be done prior to dinner time.)
