# Meatloaf (to end all meatloafs)

My wife **strongly** dislikes meatloaf. I did not know this fact when I set out on an adventure to create the *MEATLOAF TO END ALL MEATLOAFS*. She was a good sport and didn't even mention it as she helped me collect ingredients from the store and our pantry. I had been very interested in learning to cook after binge watching Good Eats. In one episode (I think) he mentioned the key ingredients to a good meatloaf and how starting with a good recipe and tweaking it with things you liked could be a great way to find your own recipe. Challenge Accepted!

The following resulted from a bunch of experiments and while I joke about this recipe being a champ it really is quite good. In fact, my wife is the one who asks me to make it most often.
