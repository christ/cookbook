# Cinnamon chip muffins

##Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* 1 bag of cinnamon chips

##Directions
1. Whisk the egg, milk and oil. 
2. Normal people with real recipes tell you to mix the dry ingredients separately. Honestly, I just dump it all on top of the wet and mix. Flour first, then sprinkle the other stuff so there isn't a giant clump of baking powder or something. 
2.5. If you need to do it "right," then mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and spices. Then make a well in the dry and pour in the wet. 

Don't overmix. You can never have too-lumpy muffin batter. 
3. Drop a little bit of flour (just 2 tablespoons or so should be plenty) into the bag of cinnamon chips and shake to coat them. That keeps them from sinking. Pour them all into the batter and stir in.
4. Spoon into 12 greased or paper lined muffin cups. 
5. Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.

##Finishing Options
* Brush the tops with melted butter and dip into cinnamon sugar. 
* Cream cheese frosting
* Basic vanilla sugar glaze
* Don't waste time with any of that and just shove them in your face.

A note about cinnamon–have you bought new cinnamon lately? I was talking to a friend in the process of making these about how it really is the first spice to go bad. And not really bad, but just flavorless. I bought a new jar of cinnamon for the second batch, and the difference was astounding. If your cinnamon is more than a few months old, it’s time to toss it. But buy the new one first and smell the difference. You’ll be astounded.
